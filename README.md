# ** ♥️ Detect Heart Disease using Machine Learning**  

##  **Project Overview**  
This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease using machine learning models trained on clinical patient data. The dataset contains various health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results.

## ** Features**  
 **Loads dataset from GitHub automatically**  
 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations**  
 **Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)**  
 **Trains a Random Forest model for classification**  
 **Displays model performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)**
